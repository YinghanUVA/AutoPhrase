The paper presents the results of development of an object-oriented systemological method used to design complex systems. A formal system representation, as well as an axiomatics of the calculus of systems as functional flow-type objects based on a Node-Function-Object class hierarchy are proposed. A formalized NFO/UFO analysis algorithm and CASE tools used to support it are considered\"\n",
